# OHSDM v1.0 Summary
**Updated:** 2025-09-04T21:17:41Z

OHSDM unifies OSINT SourceDocs, Sites, Measurements, GenomicObservations, and EpiEvents in one envelope with governance
(security classification, redactions), provenance (sources, license), audit trail, and lifecycle metadata. Body is resource-specific
and geospatial/temporal friendly. Designed to complement FHIR/HL7 with lighter public-health intelligence focus.
